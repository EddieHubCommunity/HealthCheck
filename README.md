# HealthCheck

How friendly is your GitHub Open Source Repo? This project will check to make sure you are using Best Practices to attract more users, contributors and Stars, as well as suggest steps as to how you can improve the Repo to achieve this.

## Quickstart guide for local development

> [!CAUTION]
> Node `v21+` is required

1. Clone this GitHub Repo
2. Install the dependencies with `npm ci`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (you will need an environment key from Flagsmith, this is shown later on)
4. Create a **free** account on Flagsmith https://www.flagsmith.com (you can also sign in with GitHub)
5. Create an Organisation and Project
6. Create the Feature Flags with these steps

   a. Create the feature `tagline` by clicking `Create Feature`

   b. Fill in the Feature Flag form with these details and click `Create Feature`

   c. (OPTIONAL) Import the flags to your Flagsmith account using the file `src/config/flagsmith.json` (note this will be per environment, for example `development`)

7. Get your environment key from Flagsmith and add to `.env` file

8. To be able to log in using GitHub OAuth

   a. create a GitHub OAuth app on GitHub https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app

   ![GitHub OAuth app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf2e4358-4b13-4c86-a8bb-5c6d83c37b4a)

   b. In your GitHub OAuth app, GitHub will generate the `client id` and `client secret`, add these to your the `.env` file

9. Run the project with one of these

   a. If you have Postgres installed, you can run the app locally `npm run dev` OR
   
   b. If you don't have Postgres installed, you can use Docker Compose to run the database and the app `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d`, after the containers are ready, run the command `npm run db:migrate:dev`

   c. Running in Github Codespaces
      1. Start a new codespace
      2. Run `npm ci` and `npm run dev`
      3. When the project is running in the browser visit this and copy the generated URL. You will use this URL in place of localhost in step 8 above for creating your OAuth app
      4. Update the environment file with your client id and secret.  Make sure to also update the `NEXTAUTH_URL=` to the generated codespace URL as well.
      5. Continue with step `9b` to run the docker container and database migration.
